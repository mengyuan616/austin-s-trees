The dilemma: Saving trees from land development
By Mengyuan Dong

Austin and its residents have worked for decades to protect and grow one of the city’s most precious resources, trees. But seeking balance between profitability and environmental protection can be challenging. 

From 2012 to 2018, nearly 80,000 inches of trees are removed each year because of commercial development in Austin, which can fill about 550 football fields. But only about a third of these trees are replanted. 

An intractable conflict

“Development is an integral part of the challenge for any urban forest,” said Emily King, manager of the City of Austin’s Urban Forest Program. “Austin continues to experience increases in population, and development is definitely a large stressor to our canopy.”

Christopher Dolph, research analyst of the Development Service Department for the City of Austin, created a dataset about all commercial cases that led to tree removals in the past seven years. 

“We will definitely consider how much impact it will have to the trees when deciding whether to approve a case, because the first goal is always to preserve the trees,” Dolph said.

However, King said although the first priority in the development context is to preserve trees on site, this is not feasible in many cases. 

When trees are permitted to be removed, it’s ideal to have new trees planted back on the same site for mitigation, but it can be hard for the site to handle as many trees as before. In that case, responsible developers will have to pay money into the Urban Forest Replenishment Fund for compensation. According to the City of Austin’s tree preservation ordinance, the standard value of one caliper inch of replaced trees is equivalent to $200, but it may vary depending on the number of trees and site conditions. 

Based on the analysis of Dolph’s dataset, consolidation accounts for most tree removals, where there is readjustment and rearrangement of fragmented land parcels, such as constructing a restaurant or an office building with associated improvements. Consolidation takes up more than 70 percent of all cases approved within seven years. 

Except for a few cases that meet the exemption requirements, all commercial site plans need to go through strict review procedures based on comprehensive decisions of various departments, according to the city’s Development Services Department. For consolidated site plans, the review contains two major parts: one for how the land is going to be used, the other for what potential impact the plan has on the city. And the tree protection aspect is taken into account through the second part. 
Regardless of work types, King said it can be complex endeavor when it comes to replanting,  because trees must be properly selected for planting based on species, growth rate and pattern, location, etc.

Joint effort to protect trees

The fees developers pay for tree loss benefit tree-planting programs such as TreeFolks, said its director of reforestation Andreina Alexatos.  

Launched in 1988, TreeFolks has worked with communities throughout Central Texas in tree preservation, and it also partners with the city of Austin for different programs, such as neighborhood giveaways and community tree plantings. 

In rural areas, tree removals are often caused by agriculture and grazing, while in urban areas, commercial development is the top reason.

“development often strips cities of trees instead of working with them,” Alexatos said. 

Alexatos said trees do more for the environment than just provide oxygen. Due to forest’s ability to sequester carbon, clean water, clean air, control erosion and provide wildlife habitat, 
reforestation is the most efficient strategy to tackle environmental problems encountered in any modern city, she added.

According to its 2017 annual report, TreeFolks has helped plant about 430,000 trees and raise more than $250,000.

“The ongoing fight”

As an unfunded mandate, Urban Forest Program seeks to minimize the negative impact of land development on trees since implemented in 2014. Although the program coordinates with different city departments that touch trees and each of these have budgets, King said the fact that the project itself lacks funds still can’t be ignored.

“Our forestry programs continue to be underfunded. And there has always been a gap in funding for urban forestry operations within the city,” King said.

In 2016, King wrote an analysis of the funding issues of the City of Austin’s public tree care. As reported, in the comparison of urban forest maintenance spending in 14 major U.S. cities, Austin ranked second to last. Austin spent about $8.57 per tree, compared with the average level of 14 cities, $34.6.

King said with the recommended levels of service associated with urban forestry goals, Austin would see resulting spending rates of $86 per tree.
Apart from commercial development, King said climate change is the biggest challenge that Austin’s trees are facing right now. Forest health threats, such as oak wilt and the Emerald Ash Borer are also adversely affecting the urban forest plan, she added. 

“Two years ago when the Texas state legislature was in session, there was a lot of discussion and scrutiny over tree ordinances and city's ability to self-govern,” King said. “There is interest at the state level for curbing what cities regulate.”

Alexatos said riparian, urban and rapidly urbanizing areas in Austin have the most need for reforestation. It also shown in the map that downtown and its surroundings are most concentrated for commercial construction.

“Trees provide millions if not billions of dollars mitigated through our overall health benefits,” Alexatos said. “And awareness is especially significant now.”
