# austin-trees
This is a data project I did for a data journalism class at UT Austin. In this project, I used **R** to analyze how commercial development has led to Austin’s tree removals and affected the city’s Urban Forest plan. The data was from data.austintexas.gov, which shows all types of commercial development that will entail impact to Austin’s trees from Jan 1, 2012, to one day prior to the current date.
